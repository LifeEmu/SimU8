# SimU8

An nX-U8/100 simulator written in C. This has nothing to do with CASIO's `SimU8.dll`.

Not finished yet.

If you want to use features in `./src/mmu.c`, include it; If you want to use features in `./src/core.c`, include **_only_** `./src/core.c`, as it already uses features in `mmu.c`.

Tested with gcc 3.4.5 from MinGW64, and it compiles with no error/warning.
